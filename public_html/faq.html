					<h4>What's this website all about?</h4>
					<p>
						MadSwag is an online game network for sports fans and sports bars! We run free football brackets every week. You pick the winner and the spread for each, and we rank you against your friends and players worldwide. And if you play with one of the businesses in our network, you could win gift certificates every week!
          </p>
          <p>
            See the <a href = '#barsAndPrizes'>Bars and Prizes</a> section for more details about prize pools.

          <h4>How does MadSwag help sports bars?</h4>
          <p>
            Check out our <a href = 'forbars.php'>sports bar information page</a>, where we explain how we help you bring in traffic, reward your loyal customers, and make game day more fun.
          </p>
        </div>
				<div id ='gambling'>
					<h4>Is this gambling?</h4>
					<p>
						This is NOT a gambling website. The games are free to play. We will never ask for money or your credit card number.

        <div id = 'scoring'>
          <h4>How are my picks graded?</h4>
          <p>
            You begin each week with a perfect grade of 100%, and gradually lose points for picking the wrong team to win or guessing the spread incorrectly. Picking the winners correctly is the most important component of your grade. <a href = "scoring.php">Click here</a> for a full explanation &#151; with equations!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id = 'scoreGradeDiff'>
          <h4>What's the difference between my "score" and my "grade"?</h4>
          <p>
            Since a <a href = "scoring.php">perfect score is 10,000 points</a>, your grade looks like your score with the decimal point moved two spaces to the left. For example, if your score one week is 7,892 points, your grade for that week is 78.92%.

					<h4>How can I win gift certificates?</h4>
					<p>
						After you log in, go to the <a href = 'findbar.php'>Bars</a> page and select the bar or restaurant you want to win gift certificates from. Then go to the <a href = 'games.php'>Games</a> page, select one of our current games, and submit your picks. Choosing a bar after you submit your picks is fine, too. Just make sure you do both, or you won't be eligible for prizes.
					</p>
					<p>
						When you win a prize, you will be automatically notified by e-mail. When you go to pick up your prize at your sports bar, bring a photo ID to prove who you are and a receipt from a prior visit to prove you're a returning customer. You can check with the staff of your bar to see if they will accept anything else in lieu of a receipt, such as liking the bar on Facebook, joining the bar's mailing list, or beating the owner in an arm-wrestling contest.<a href = '#footnote1'>*</a> (See also: <a href = '#emailPrize'>Can't you just e-mail my gift certificate to me?</a>)
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id ='changebar'>
					<h4>Can I switch to a different sports bar if I already picked one to play with?</h4>
					<p>
						Sure. Just go to the <a href = 'findbar.php'>Bars</a> page and select a different bar or restaurant. Just one thing: You have to switch to the new bar before the games begin that week.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id = 'multiple'>
					<h4>Can I select multiple bars for the same set of picks?</h4>
					<p>
						No, you can only play with one bar at a time.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id = 'bePresent'>
					<h4>Do I have to be present in the bar on game day in order to claim my prize?</h4>
					<p>
						Nope. You will be notified by e-mail if you win a prize, and you can go to pick up your gift certificate at any time after that. Make sure you bring your ID and your receipt! (See also: <a href = '#howgiftcert'>How can I win gift certificates?</a>)
					</p>
				</div>
        <div id = 'emailPrize'>
          <h4>Can't you just e-mail my gift certificate to me?</h4>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, no. MadSwag uses physical gift cards and gift certificates in order to prevent fraud and maintain the integrity of the game. As an added security measure, when you go to claim your prize your sports bar may check your photo ID against the name you entered during registration. Tying your account to a real-life identity helps prevent people from gaming the system by entering thousands of sets of picks using pseudonyms. We will never share your real name with anyone other than the sports bar you chose to play with, and even then we will only give them your name if you win a prize.
