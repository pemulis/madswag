<h2>5. THE “PROMOTION PERIOD”.</h2>
<p>
  The Promotion Period begins on 7pm EST on May 30th and ends on August 15th (or upon the completion of the first week of preseason games in the 2011 pro football season).
</p>

<h2>6. THE "COMPETITION GROUP".</h2> 
<p>
  Your Competition Group shall consist of all of the eligible players playing with Game Hosts in your "Host Group". Your Host Group shall consist of no more than five (5) Game Hosts, including your own Game Host. Game Hosts are sorted into Host Groups according to their Ranking, which is determined by the Sponsor.
</p>

<h2>7. HOW TO PLAY.</h2>

<p>
  a. General. The objective of the Promotion is to obtain the highest score within your Competition Group by more accurately predicting the winner(s) and certain game statistics (such as the spread) during the first week of preseason games in the 2011 pro football season.
</p>
<p>
  b. Scoring. From all eligible entries received within a Competition Group, the winners will be determined based on their ability to use their skill and knowledge of 2011 Week 1 Preseason Pro Football to accumulate the most points during the Promotion Period. The system for awarding points is described on the Scoring System page at <a href = "http://madswag.com/scoring.php">http://madswag.com/scoring.php</a>. In the event of a tie, two or more prize tiers will be combined and prizes of equal value will be distributed to each of the players involved in the tie. (For example: If there is a two-way tie for first place, the first-place prize is worth $200, and the second-place prize is worth $100, each of the two tied players will receive a prize worth $150. The next prize awarded will be for third place.)
</p>
<p>
  c. Lockout Time. The system will "lock" at a scheduled time to prevent further pick submission (the "Lockout Time"). The entrant's picks must be submitted, received and recorded by Sponsor's computer by the Lockout Time in order to be counted. Sponsor's computer is the official time keeping device for this Promotion. The Lockout Time for this Promotion is 7pm EST on August 11th.
</p>
<p>
  d. Limit. One (1) entry per person. Each player must have a unique MadSwag.com user account tied to a unique real-life identity.

</p>
<p>
  NO ENTRY FEE; NO PURCHASE REQUIRED. There is no entry fee or purchase required to participate in the Promotion. Purchase will not affect your odds of winning. Only entries received online in accordance with these Official Rules will be accepted. No other forms of entry will be accepted. Entry materials/data that have been tampered with or altered are void.
</p>

<h2>8. PRIZES.</h2>
<p>
  The approximate retail value ("ARV") of all prizes is equal to the number of Game Hosts in your Host Group multiplied by $100, which is the amount contributed to the prize pool by each Game Host.
</p>
<p>
  Odds of winning prizes depend on the total number of eligible entries received and the relative professional football knowledge of all entrants.
</p>

<h2>9. ENTRY ERRORS/ NO RETURN OF ENTRIES; DISPUTES.</h2>
<p>
  Neither Sponsor nor Promoters are responsible for lost, late, incomplete, damaged, stolen, invalid, unintelligible or misdirected entries, which will be disqualified. Neither Sponsor nor Promoters are responsible for any unavailability of or interruptions to any service or equipment used in connection with the Promotion, including, without limitation, (1) interruptions to any network, server, Internet, website, telephone, satellite, computer or other connections (2) failures of any telephone, satellite, hardware, software or other equipment, (3) garbled, misdirected or jumbled transmissions, or traffic congestion, or (4) other errors of any kind, whether human, technical, mechanical or electronic, or (5) the incorrect or inaccurate capture of entry or other information or the failure to capture any such information.
</p>
<p>
  Once submitted, entries become the sole property of Sponsor and will not be acknowledged or returned. In the event of a dispute as to any entry, the authorized account holder, i.e., natural person, of the email address used to register will be deemed to be the registrant. Potential winners may be required to show proof of identification. Sponsor may require that the potential winner provide proof that he/she is the authorized account holder of the e-mail address and/or username associated with the winning entry.
</p>

<h2>10. POTENTIAL WINNERS.</h2> 
<p>
  All potential winning players are subject to verification by Sponsor, whose decisions are final. Sponsor shall solely determine any form of verification. Sponsor may require potential winning players to provide verification to a specified Promoter. An entrant is not a winner of any prize unless and until Entrant’s eligibility and the potential winning entry has been verified and Entrant has been notified that verification is complete. Sponsor will not accept screen shots, affidavits or other evidence in lieu of its validation process. Any entry that occurs after the system has failed for any reason may be deemed a defective entry and void.
</p>

<p>
  Potential winners will be notified via email (or overnight mail) sent within fifteen (15) business days following the end of the Promotion Period.  It is the sole responsibility of the entrant to notify the Sponsor during the Promotion Period if his or her e-mail address has changed.
</p>
<p>
  A potential winner will be disqualified and an alternate potential winner will be selected (i.e., the next highest scorer) if (i) he/she does not comply with these rules (or is otherwise determined to be ineligible), (ii) the emailed prize notice, after three (3) attempts, is returned as undeliverable, or (iii) the prize is undeliverable for any reason. If Sponsor notifies, or seeks to deliver a prize to or otherwise attempts to contact an alternate potential winner, and such alternate potential winner is subsequently disqualified then Sponsor shall use its reasonable judgment to determine, in its sole discretion, the disposition of the prize (e.g., may choose another alternate potential winner in a manner consistent with these rules or donate the prize to another entity, at its sole discretion).
</p>
<p>
  If a potential winner is a minor in his/her jurisdiction of primary residence, potential winner's parent/legal guardian must execute all documents and agree to all obligations and undertakings required of the potential winner in these Official Rules, both on behalf of himself/herself and the potential winning minor. Prize may be awarded in the name of, or to, parent/legal guardian.
</p>
<p>
  Winning a prize is contingent upon fulfilling all requirements set forth herein. Winners are solely responsible for any and all expenses, relative to participation in the Promotion (including acceptance of any prize) not specified herein.
</p>
<p>

  No cash or other prize substitution, assignment or transfer of prizes permitted, except at Sponsor's sole discretion due to prize unavailability. Sponsor reserves the right to substitute a prize with one of comparable value or greater value (e.g., Sponsor may opt instead to award the cash equivalent of any prize in lieu of the prize itself). THE WINNER IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECEIPT OR USE OF ANY PRIZE. Gift Certificates are NOT redeemable/exchangeable for cash. Other restrictions may apply.
</p>
<p>
  Except where prohibited, participation in this Promotion constitutes winner's consent to Sponsor's and Promoters', and any of their respective agents' use of winner's name, likeness, voice, opinions and biographical information for publicity, advertising, trade or promotional purposes in any media or manner, now known or hereafter devised, worldwide, without further payment, consideration, notice or approval.

CAUTION: A PERSON WHO ATTEMPTS DELIBERATELY TO UNDERMINE THE LEGITIMATE OPERATION OF THIS PROMOTION OR TO ALTER OR DAMAGE A WEBSITE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND/OR CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND FINES; AND SPONSOR RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SEEK DAMAGES FROM ANY SUCH PERSON TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

</p>

In the event of a cancellation or termination by the Sponsor the entrant who has accumulated the highest point total (and who wins any pending tiebreakers) at the time of any said action will be awarded the prizes, or the prizes will be awarded in such other manner deemed fair and appropriate by Sponsor.
