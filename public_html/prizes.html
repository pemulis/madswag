        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          It's easy to compete for gift certificates to local sports bars by entering your picks on MadSwag. There are prizes every week, and the games are always free! Here's what you do:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p><a href = 'findbar.php'>Select a bar</a> and enter your picks for one of our <a href = 'games.php'>current games</a>.</p></li>
          <li><p>Visit the bar, and save your receipt!</p></li>
          <li><p>When the week's games are over, check your e-mail to see your results.</p></li>
          <li><p>If you won, turn in your receipt at the bar to claim your prize.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>
It only takes a minute or two to enter your picks. But just like in fantasy sports, research and strategy help!
