        <h1 class = "center">Scoring System</h1>
        <h2>Basics</h2>
          <p>
            For every pick set, no matter what sport or event, you begin with a perfect score of 10,000 points. Points are deducted from your score for picking the wrong team to win and for guessing the spread incorrectly. The only way to earn a perfect score is to correctly pick the winner and the spread of every game.
          </p>
        <h2>Picking the Wrong Team to Win</h2>
          <p>
            You can lose a maximum of 5,000 points, or 50% of your grade, for picking the wrong teams to win. The amount deducted for each incorrect pick depends on how many total games there are in the set. The simple formula is:
          </p>
          <p class = 'center'>
            5,000 / (number of games in set) = (amount deducted for each incorrect pick)
          </p>
        <h2>Guessing the Spread Incorrectly</h2>
          <p>
            If you picked the wrong team to win, the amount deducted from your score is the sum of the predicted spread and the actual spread.
          </p>
          <p class = 'center'>
            (predicted spread) + (actual spread) = (amount deducted)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you picked the right team to win, the amount deducted from your score is the absolute value of the difference between the predicted spread and the actual spread.
          </p>
          <p class = 'center'>
            | (predicted spread) - (actual spread) | = (amount deducted)
          </p>
          <p>
            If you picked the right team to win and guessed the spread correctly, no points will be deducted.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>For low-scoring sports like baseball, hockey, and soccer, multiply the amount deducted by 5.</em>
          </p>
        <h2>Leaderboard</h2>
          <p>
            After each game, we update the number of games you've played and your overall points total, and use this to calculate your overall grade.
          </p>
          <p class = 'center'>
            (overall points total) / (number of games played) / 100 = (overall grade)
          </p>
          <p>
            The meaning of your grade is the same as in school: A grade of 70% is average, and a grade higher than 90% means you did an awesome job.
