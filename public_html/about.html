          <p>
            John has been building websites since middle school. He's been involved in everything from video game fansites to Facebook apps to e-book publishing. MadSwag began as a personal project in college, to keep track of he and his friends' football picks. When he isn't working on MadSwag, he likes to write, travel, and drink IPAs. (Okay, he likes to drink IPAs <i>while</i> working on MadSwag, too.)
